# Project 2

Description: A single-page, responsively-designed website for searching images using the Instagram API. The site will populate the twelve most recently uploaded images based on the hashtag that is entered.

Tools and methods used:
-HTML and CSS
-Javascript and jQuery
-Ajax
-Instagram API
-responsive-design
-Gulp and Sass
-Git and Github

Experience:
There was a large learning curve for fetching images using the API, but once I knew what to look for it became easier. Gulp was also confusing at first, the variety of tasks and variables is large, but when they are working properly seeing how changes affect the site was much more convenient. Sass was another area of difficulty but it has paid off a lot when I want to edit a particular section and makes the whole project more navigable.
